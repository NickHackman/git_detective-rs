## Why?

I haven't graded much at [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/), but I'm
already sick and tired of having to walk an entire student's git repository
counting lines of code to see if they're contributing enough to the group.

## Goals

- Display a list of contributors to a repository
- Show a `github`-esque breakdown based on all contributors
- When clicking on a contributor see the amount of lines of code written in the
  final product that they have written broken up based on language, represented
  as a pie chart. Furthermore, breaking down those lines of code as comments or
  actual code.
- When clicking on a contributor show the commits they've made in a timeline
  starting from the first commit to the last one, show this as a line chart
  and allow each commit to be clicked on to show a breakdown similar to the
  final product pie chart.
- A nice clean and intuitive interface
